However, the relevance of the topic as a reference standard in activities related to scientific theses, associated with its good presentation, make it a contribution. It is suggested, with a view to a magazine publication, that the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities without the support of these tools be compared versus the current reality (with tools).

Likewise, they describe specific tools and their benefits, such as, for example, Latex and Git. Finally, they propose a workflow for the development of projects of this nature. The main value of the article lies in the application of knowledge that students already master - that is, software development techniques and tools - to a different problem such as the theses and reports. All of this, with the aim of making the process more efficient. 1.- The emphasis of the article is on the solution without making a detailed analysis of the problem that is intended to be solved. In other words, there are no answers to the following questions: a.- What exactly is the problem? b.- What impacts does this problem generate? c.- Why is it important to solve the problem? d.- What solutions have been implemented to date? e.- What advantages does the proposed solution have compared to the previous ones? 2.- In my opinion, the article should emphasize the methodology and workflow more. For example, adding a diagram -using visual language- that allows, on the one hand, to understand the general process of thesis development and, on the other, to distinguish the roles, activities and technologies associated in each phase of the report. 3.- Some aspects of the language and the rigor of certain statements must be taken care of, such as, for example: ""(given the rather atrocious spelling that engineers enjoy)"".

In addition, the use of software engineering is appreciated in the construction of the application, which is a very positive aspect, since generally when software creation is involved in frontier areas of knowledge, it is resorts to code-and-fix, with all the disadvantages that this entails.

Using RMI, in my opinion, is not a contribution per se, since RMI is easy. to use if JAVA is used, however, it is not interoperable since it does not support other programming languages. In addition, RMI-based systems have a performance problem as they grow; The more they grow, the slower they become.

Regarding the area of ​​​​grid computing and distributed systems, the manuscript does not contain relevant aspects, it uses RMI to implement a client/server system, however, RMI is easy to use and as a good known paradigm in computing, performance is contrasted with ease of use, RMI does not escape that, because it is easy to use, but it does not have scalability.

Commercial systems for this type of development can, in most cases, have very high costs, depending on the type of elements used. - Despite the simplicity of the proposed architecture, I believe that the system can be improved.

Why not use stereo vision (maybe the costs are similar)? The second problem found is a consequence of the first, since when trying to explain what computer vision is, it has been too long (a little more than three columns), and too general. Perhaps if attention had been focused on the state of the art I would not see this as a problem. - On the technical side I see that your approach can work in a very controlled environment, where there are no major changes in lighting and the surface of the scanned objects are of colors that are not very similar to the background and/or laser beam used. Background subtraction for controlled environments may work but outdoors I doubt your system will be as stable. I think the text could have listed the different methods used for segmentation. On page 4 it is referenced but not delved into (""For segmentation, different methods were tested, of which the image subtraction method was selected...""). Perhaps it would be good to take advantage of some color space (RBG, YUV, etc.) and use the Mahalanobis distance (get a sample of one or several laser beams) to obtain better segmentation of the laser light. - Regarding the presentation, I have found some errors that would be good to improve: - Figure 2 and figure 3 have the same title, I think there is an error with the title of figure 3. - Figure 2 has some errors and that can mislead to error.

Practical experience papers must provide more than a simple description of the developed system: they must clearly indicate what new knowledge, technique or solution was obtained from said experience. Consequently, a paper of this nature should include, at least, the following essential elements: - An introduction that clearly explains the purpose of the work: (a) the problem that was solved directly or indirectly with practical experience, (b) why the problem is important and non-trivial and (c) why this experience provided new information within said context (not obtained with similar experiences). - Theoretical framework - The description of the system: it should not be a mere enumeration of its components and functionalities, but rather clearly indicate those elements that, during its development, provided relevant information to the problem of the study. - Conclusions: they must be aligned with the elements of the introduction and must be supported by the evidence provided in the system description. Analyzing the paper from this perspective, we found important problems: First, the introduction is not clear regarding the purpose of the work and. The only part where the objectives are mentioned is in the 5th paragraph, where it is indicated that the case study is ""to empirically demonstrate the development costs"" associated with the technologies shown in the paper. This, along with ""highlighting the main features and potential virtues of CakePHP and MVC..."" seem to be the central elements of the paper. Second, the system description is not much different from a system manual; Essential evidence is missing to support the elements of the introduction: associated development costs (time, people, resources) which, it is assumed, should be lower than with another methodology. While the sections describing CakePHP and MVC have information relevant to the problem, they do not add value to the work if they are not supported by evidence obtained directly from development experience with this technology. Above all, I missed a comparison with some other similar experience, clearly indicating what development improvements CakePHP/MVC introduces. Finally, the conclusions of the paper are not aligned with the elements indicated in the introduction; some of them provide information out of context (conclusions #5 and #6) or are irrelevant (conclusion #2); others lack evidence to support them (conclusion #1) or are not explicit in associating the evidence with what is concluded (conclusions #3 and #4). Aside from the previous observations, the paper also requires improvements in the presentation of information. For example, the value that the SQL code in figures 10 and 11 delivers to the paper is not explicit. Figures 12-15 are not adequately described. A person who does not understand working with the command line well may end up completely disoriented and will not understand the arguments used.

Use a feature selection procedure.  b) Concerning the experimentation: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier's parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance).  You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences.  You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Specially when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature.  c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution. I have a few comments concerning the paper organization: a) Problem statement and literature review (intro and theoretical framework sections) are in my opinion a bit long, compared to other important sections, e.g. feature extraction and experimentation which are just one paragraph each. b) Although English is in general correct, there are some small mistakes that could be solved by having it read by a professional. c) There are two ""proposed method"" sections  Well written paper.

The CBIR problem is introduced and some algorithms are presented that allow accelerating the searches for nearest neighbors to an input vector (corresponding to an image) in the feature space chosen to represent the images. Color, frequency response, and global features are used for each of the local frames into which an input image is divided. In this way, information of different types is introduced into the CBIR system to represent the images. - The article does not clearly define its contributions. It seems to add something to the feature space in which images are represented, and it also seems to add something to the algorithms and data structures needed to speed up searches in metric spaces. - In general the article uses little space to explain the proposed approach to CBIR (two references are given to master's thesis). In the conclusions, experimental results are presented, when clearly they should go in a previous section with the experiments. - Regarding the visual characteristics used to represent an image: Experiments are lacking that allow us to establish what each of the characteristics that are proposed to be used contribute. That is, I think it is important to answer the question: Why these and not others? and also to the question: Are any of them redundant and could they be stopped being used? Although it is true that a feature selection procedure is used, an experiment is missing establishing the effect of selection. How much is gained in success rate by using the complete vector? It seems that the feature space after selection has a dimension of 3078 (section 2.4). Is this the case or have the 3078 features been extracted ""manually""? - The experiment comparing CBIR systems (section 2.3) is not understood. What is done with the 100 images common to the databases? Is the same query done in all systems and is the precision and recall measured using only the 100 common images when they appear or not in the system's response?

It is possible to run a test on some data and obtain a completely different result on others. Therefore sensitivity and specificity without reference to the data from which it was obtained are meaningless. - It seems to this reviewer that an article on CBIR should not overlook developments in Computer Vision based on local features (already classics) such as: Sivic, J. and Zisserman, A.

Regarding reference number [1], it has not been possible to obtain an electronic copy, and from the aforementioned publications [2] and [3], it can be said that there is a new contribution in the experiments carried out on GNAT and Spaghetis structures. It must be explained in the publication that the work is not original from the author's point of view, and that its extension is based on the works [1], [2], [3] or another that is directly related to the work presented. . - The text is well structured and it is easy to understand what you want to explain. - Good presentation, no serious problems. Just improve the figures in the graphs, especially the accent marks, in Matlab you can add text in latex to avoid these types of problems. The word ""more"" appears a couple of times without an accent. - In the ""Introduction"" section, although the work is presented in a general way, I think it would be important to point out the state of the art in these matters. Are there related works? Are there important references? What is the contribution of the work to the state of the art?, etc. A more exhaustive bibliographic review is missing. - In the ""Feature Extraction"" section I have found some details such as: - It has been difficult for me to find a definition of the layout technique since there is only one reference [1], so I suspect that the characteristics obtained from each sub-image as a signal which are mixed to obtain the vector that represents the total image, as it says in the text: ""The union of all the extracted features gives us the result..."", where it is not clear the type ""union"" that is performed. - The same thing also happens when the Fisher discriminant is referenced, again reference is made to [1]. A more relevant source should be added for this point. - The type of database used is not explained in detail. Is it public or private domain? What type of images or groups of images it contains. How many are there per class? Are there repeated images? Image quality. The idea is to have a framework of reference so that anyone who wants to compare their algorithms with yours does so on equal terms. - From the images shown in Figure 2, I can deduce that the database (I hope I am wrong) has repeated images, which can produce a bias when calculating the precision, sensitivity and specificity values of the recovered images. I think that the ideal database to be able to correctly measure the quality of the recovery should have different images even if they have the same appearance, but never the same. Since when recovering a set of images based on a query image, if they are repeated, the number of true positives will be proportional to the repeated ones, which will result in a bias in the calculation of the metrics. Recommendations - In the text it is mentioned (conclusions section) that the solutions are not entirely satisfactory. I believe that currently there are projects such as http://similar-images.googlelabs.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.tineye.com/, among others; which show great progress in this field and would be good to be reviewed. - On the other hand, regarding the set of features used, I recommend reviewing other types of features that have been shown to be invariant to scale and rotation.

Developing interpreters using the ANTLR tool on Android is the main connection of these activities. The first activity implements a parser/interpreter for a calculator. The second activity incorporates the ability to sort lists into the interpreter. The last activity incorporates the voice recognition service using a Google library.

General Evaluation: The work describes very clearly how the activities in the elective course were carried out.

However, a sample of why this statement is true is never offered, only how to implement the activity software is detailed. It is strongly recommended to give real signals (e.g. justifications, experiments, etc.) of why these tools help the teaching of these topics. 2) This point is the cause of the previous point. There is no motivation or problem that clearly shows the need to use these tools for a language course.

In order to analyze the contribution of co-creation, the concept of traceability is introduced. It then explains a series of variables proposed to measure the co-created value under a conceptual model together with another model that allows the traceability of the different contributions through links. Finally, the results of the model in one case are briefly presented. Evaluation: Implementing types of co-creation is very important for organizations today. It is interesting how the article mixes co-creation with traceability and proposes ways to measure it, presenting new tools for the organization. Unfortunately, the article has major weaknesses: 1) The scope may not be appropriate for a conference like INFONOR. 2) The results are brief and weakly exemplified, which makes it difficult to understand the use of the model. 3) More examples could be used for ease of reading. 4) The format of the paper has problems.

GENERAL EVALUATION: The work is well written and follows a format (almost) completely suitable for INFONOR. The application sounds interesting and potentially useful as an add-on for already commonly used social networks (e.g. Facebook).

This is so, because terra allows user registration (profiles), commenting on news, rating news, and configuring the website to display the news that a user wants. 4) This could be a minor detail, I think that the use of social networks could be used for something more than just showing the most important news (e.g. showing a kind of (social) tracking of a similar news item(s). ).

In general, we want to present the built application and do not specify what is expected from the article, the methodologies to be used and what is innovative in terms of development for the discipline of information systems. One of the main limitations of this article is the state of the art. The literature review is almost non-existent in relation to the theories that support the development of the application and the main authors on platform development issues of this nature are not mentioned. No theoretical framework is established in the article in terms of design or implementation of the application. Nor are any proposals discussed in these terms, so it is possible to say that there are no theoretical references in terms of analysis, design and implementation. This difficulty means that the evaluation of what has been developed is only based on general opinions of what the concept of information systems is. The research methodology is another important shortcoming of this article. The article moves between the importance of the application to a description of what is possible to do with it without establishing clear and accepted development and implementation methodologies (neither for the design of the tool or for the analysis of the results obtained from its use. ). This complicates the evaluation of the work since there are no research questions to answer, nor ways to evaluate whether the author's expectations are met or if the results obtained will be valid. The author of the article should present and describe the research designs to be used to allow their validity to be evaluated. Most of the article is in the development item and it defines and details the characteristics of the company in which the study will be developed. It is not clearly specified which parts of the systems are acquired commercially and which are developed internally and how the connection with other existing platforms is achieved.

The authors limit themselves to explaining the functionalities of the tool and how it will be used in the company, but it is not possible to know how it was implemented and compare the results that stand out as relevant to the implementation.

The results obtained are generally mentioned as something that was achieved and as percentages of improvements in management and it is not possible to draw valid conclusions about them. The conclusion of the article is weak in terms of the results obtained from the design and implementation of the application and above all the contribution of the study to the discipline of information systems.

reject,3.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,"Throughout the article the role of test automation within software testing and more generally in the assurance framework is exaggerated. A maturity model for software testing necessarily includes more aspects than automation. Automated cases will always coexist with manual cases and evaluations carried out by people. As discussed in the article, automation is a very general concept, it can encompass generation, execution, evaluation (for example: mutation, coverage criteria) and validation (oracle problem). Although the motivation is clearly expressed in the introduction, references are needed to substantiate the statements made about the role of testing and the impact of automation on it. Saying that automation allows testing to be done faster or at a lower cost is simplistic: this depends on the context. The costs of generating automatic test cases, the estimate on the future evaluation of the software and the expiration of the test cases, along with other factors, must be taken into account in the cost model to determine the desirability of automating a certain part of the proof. The section dedicated to software testing makes general definitions and traces the history of testing since mainframes. For a research article, I suggest making more specific definitions related to the focus of the study (experimental studies on testing techniques, automation, testing costs, maturity models). It would be appropriate to put the development of the maturity model after presenting the related work. The process to obtain the proposal of a maturity model for testing is not described. The development of the model must be linked to other existing maturity models (for example the Testing Maturity Model), connections must be established with accepted testing literature or standards (for example ISO 29119) and in general with software process models. The search string used is not made explicit. Not all models found should be classified as 'maturity models'. Some of the models included are clearly more general models, which do not focus on the problem of test automation. These differences should at least be discussed. The attributes used in Table III are not explained, nor the way to obtain the maturity level results. What does 'level of published opinions' mean? This concept is ambiguous.

,4.0,-2.0,2.0,-1.0,"The work is titled ""Current Maturity of Software Testing Automation Development."" The document shows a series of sections that report on work carried out in terms of literature review and some approaches to a proposal to restructure a scale of particular maturity levels for the test automation process. However, the work lacks a logical structure that allows determining whether its main contribution or objective is in the review of literature or in the proposal of new levels of maturity for the testing process. It is recommended to do a complete review of the information presented and possibly restructure the document presented. The report of this review was divided into sections, in order to provide suggestions that allow the work to be improved. Section -Systematic review It is important that the authors review the fact of using a systematic review method that is not yet published, there being several published, tested and recognized methods for Software engineering. They should justify the selection of the method proposed by Serna M. identified with the number [16] in the work. It is essential to explain the validation that is carried out with respect to the peer review of the articles, since it is not clear how a peer review of the published articles can be accessed in order to validate them and how a validation process is carried out from of said information, taking into account the number of revisions that would have to be made for each article found (978). Test automation Although, the work reports a proposed model to evaluate the maturity of the software test automation process. The model as such is not described. The article is limited to presenting a reference scale associated with the maturity of a human being. Therefore, it is essential that the article indicates several aspects to consider the structuring and definition of a model. Among the most important aspects to consider are: 1. A scientific and formal justification on which the authors of the work are based to propose the maturity model and the selection of the maturity levels of a human being as a point of comparison with a possible level of maturity of the test automation process. 2. Formal justification of why not use the CMMI model and the maturity level structure proposed in it to evaluate the test automation process. The above, taking into account that the maturity model defines an appropriate maturity scale to evaluate processes in software engineering. That is, why is it necessary to rethink these maturity levels for the test automation process and propose a new scale based on the maturity of a human being? 3. At the research level, how are the maturity levels characterized in terms of test automation? Although the article characterizes each level, indicating the possible characteristics of the test automation process, it does not indicate how said characterization was determined, nor is a related formal and scientific justification shown. Related work The work presents a systematic review, under which it is possible to identify work related to the area of ​​study, in this case test automation or maturity levels for test automation. However, the authors present the systematic review separately from the related work section, when it seems that the studies selected as related work should be part of the analysis of the results of the systematic review. Furthermore, the systematic review makes it possible to determine research gaps or niches (research opportunities) to determine an area of ​​work with a specific problem and, from there, propose a possible solution to said problem. In this case, the article presents the systematic review as additional work and subsequent to the proposal of maturity levels for the test automation process. Likewise, the authors show the selection of some related works, it is understood that they are related to test automation, however the first Michael Grottke, indicate precisely that he does not focus on the topic to be discussed in the work they present but on a statistical proposal for test automation. Therefore it would not enter as a related work. Maturity of software test automation development To make a comparison of the test automation process and maturity levels, the authors present Table 3. It indicates that the first column contains the traditional stages of a testing process. It is necessary to indicate under which methodology these stages are selected as traditional or to have a reference as a justification for the selection of these and not other stages. In this section there is no clear explanation of the determination of the maturity levels in each stage. It is essential to have described the research analysis carried out that results in the definition of the maturity level of each of the stages of the testing process. The table is not sufficient explanation for the analysis, as it only reports the results. At this point, if what you are looking for is to propose a new maturity scale for the testing or test automation process, it is most convenient to validate said proposed scale with a case study. In this work, although the authors show a table where they seem to determine that the maturity level is ""adolescent"", it is not possible to understand in what context the test automation process is being evaluated. At least one case should be contextualized, indicating: region, time, type of projects or companies and methodology used to evaluate the test automation process. The above is the basis to justify that in a certain context the test automation process is at X level of maturity (of the proposed scale). Also arguing the criteria that were taken into account to assign said level of maturity.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.954, 'pos': 0.029, 'compound': 0.685}",Positive
